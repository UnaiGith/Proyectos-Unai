# https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings
#
# This file manages how Git reads line endings in a specific repository.
# When you commit this file to a repository, it overrides the core.autocrlf setting for all repository contributors.
# This ensures consistent behavior for all users, regardless of their Git settings and environment.
#
# A .gitattributes file looks like a table with two columns:
# * On the left is the file name for Git to match.
# * On the right is the line ending configuration that Git should use for those files.


# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
# This matches all files. Git will handle the files in whatever way it thinks is best.
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized
# and converted to native line endings on checkout.
*.py text
*.java text
*.sql text
*.json text
*.xml text
*.properties text
*.yaml text
*.yml text
*.md text
lombok.config text
Vagrantfile text

# Declare files that will always have LF line endings on checkout.
# Git will always convert line endings to LF on checkout.
# You should use this for files that must keep LF endings, even on Windows.
# If this repo is accessed in Unix via a file share from Windows, the scripts will work.
*.sh text eol=lf

# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
*.png binary
*.drawio binary
